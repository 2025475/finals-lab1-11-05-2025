            <blockquote>
                <p>Originally, my first option was to take STEM, but sadly, my grades didn't reach the required level. So, I decided to take ICT instead. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise!</p>

            <p>The environment was different for me. My classmates were <mark>unique</mark> and unlike what I expected. However, I was quick to adapt and even found myself enjoying the differences.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #35424a;">Making Friends and Memories</h2>
            <p>The fun part was meeting new people. We bonded over common interests like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing games together</li>
                <li>Exploring new places to eat</li>
                <li>Collaborating on projects</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Favorite Games</dt>
                <dd>- Mobile Legends, Valorant, GTA , Minecraft, and Codm.</dd>
                <dt>Best Food Spots</dt>
                <dd>- Canteen, Local Cafes, Pancake house ,or Fastfood Restaurants.</dd>

            <h2 style="color: #35424a;">Memorable Projects</h2>
            <p>One of the best projects was the <strong>Music Video</strong> assigned by ma'am Dahlia. We enjoyed it immensely because we got to brainstorm creative ideas and made some fantastic memories along the way.</p>
            <p>We also had a blast working on the Arduino booth, especially since we collaborated with our <em>ate's</em> and <em>kuya's</em>, which made it even more special.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #35424a;">Bittersweet Endings</h2>
            <p>As the school days were coming to an end, I felt a tinge of sadness knowing that I might not see some of my friends again. But that's the beauty of life; it's always about new beginnings.</p>
            <p>So, here I am, ready to start a new chapter in my Grade 12 ICT journey.</p>
